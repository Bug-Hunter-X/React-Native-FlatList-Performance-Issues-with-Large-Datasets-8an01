The solution involves several key optimizations:

1. **`windowSize`**:  Setting a `windowSize` prop on the `FlatList` reduces the number of items rendered at a time. This significantly improves performance by only rendering visible and nearby items, rather than attempting to render all items at once.

2. **`getItemLayout`**: Using the `getItemLayout` prop allows the `FlatList` to calculate the position of each item without rendering, enhancing scrolling smoothness and performance. This is particularly helpful with large datasets.

3. **Item Component Optimization**:  The solution includes optimization to the item component to reduce its rendering complexity. This might involve simplifying the UI or using techniques like `useMemo` or `React.memo` to optimize re-renders.

```javascript
// FlatListBugSolution.js
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
  windowSize={10} // Adjust as needed
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({ length: ITEM_HEIGHT, offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index, index })} // Assuming a constant item height
/>
```

By implementing these optimizations, the `FlatList` component can handle large datasets more efficiently, preventing crashes and improving the overall user experience.
